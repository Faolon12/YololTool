# YololCopyPaste HotFix Notes
<b>Please note that V.1 and V.2 do not work in the ship designer. 1.1 and 2.1 do, please check them out!</b>

Both of the hotfixes now work in the ship designer, there are now 2 hotkeys for pasting! outside the editor you have to press down arrow once to move down a line, in the designer you have to press it twice. this script relies on that. 
NEW HOTKEYS, To paste in the designer, by default its now CTRL+Numpad 7 for copy buffer 1, its CTRL+Numpad8 for 2, and CTRL+Numpad9 for 3,
The cut tool has been disabled, it can be easily re-enabled by removing the ";" and giving it a hotkey.

<b>Another note, in the designer you must be able to see all the lines visualy from line 1, to 20, or the script decides it will stop pasting.</b>
