# YololCopyPaste HotFix Notes
<b>Please note that V.1 and V.2 do not work in the ship designer. 1.1 and 2.1 do, please check them out!</b>

Both of the hotfixes now work in the ship designer, there are now 2 hotkeys for pasting! outside the editor you have to press down arrow once to move down a line, in the designer you have to press it twice. this script relies on that. 
NEW HOTKEYS, To paste in the designer, by default its now CTRL+Windows+B Outside editor its still CTRL+Windows+V
 to copy, just copy normaly 
<b>Another note, in the designer you must be able to see all the lines visualy from line 1, to 20, or the script decides it will stop pasting.</b>
